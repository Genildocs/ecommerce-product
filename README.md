## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev/) - React framework
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I Learned

- Implemented Swiper to create product sliders, synchronizing the main slide with the thumbnail slider.
- Developed an auto-progress feature using SVG icon styling and the `useRef` hook.
- Optimized animations with Framer Motion by animating only necessary CSS properties, preventing reflow and improving layout performance.
- Used the `useEffect` hook to update a boolean variable by detecting changes in `count`.
- Applied Tailwind CSS for responsiveness based on breakpoints.

### Continuous Development

- Constantly improving code efficiency and performance through best practices.
- Staying updated with new technologies and frameworks to enhance development skills.
- Refining UI/UX by iterating on user feedback and testing.
- Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code for long-term project sustainability.
